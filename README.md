# HyPlan

HyPlan is a Python package designed to facilitate the planning and execution of airborne remote sensing science campaigns. With tools for sensor viewing geometry calculations, flight line planning, glint analysis, and more, HyPlan helps scientists and mission planners streamline their workflow and maximize data collection efficiency.

## Features

- **Flight Line Planning**: Tools for designing optimal flight lines based on mission parameters.
- **Swath Calculations**: Compute sensor swath coverage considering local terrain 
- **Glint Analysis**: Predict sun glint based on sensor characteristics, flight line geometry, and solar position 
- **Sensor Calculations**: Calculate swath width and pixel size as a function of altitude. Calculate critical ground speed as a function of altitude and sensor frame rate.
- **Airports**: Find nearby airports filtered by runway length/surface criteria

## Installation

To install HyPlan, use the following command:

```bash
pip install hyplan
```
